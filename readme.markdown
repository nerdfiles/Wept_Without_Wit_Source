# A Query

These are explorations into the externalization of a supposed homogeneous organization of pheNOMonological, or being candid: pre-ontological experience, should the neologism be so repugnant to the mind. Supposing experience is intentionally structured, what might categorically dissimilar experiences, such as the linguistic experience and the physical experience; allowing that one perceives their vacuity in canonicalization. Bankruptcy follows at assuming the logical equivalence of the world as a totality of parts and language as a totality of canonical forms; where each presupposes a prior lexical representation. In that, to ask questions within such a supposed organization of experience, intentionally structured, what would its reverberation sound like?

# A Response

It is not enough to say "self-taught"; these are sonic transliterations of self to public, undergone seemingly tragic loss and the bankruptcy of post-analytic reasoning. I have no interest in the guitar as a philosophical, paradigmatic project, with its normative claims, language games, and 138 different nail shapes.

# Albums

1. Death Rites (October 2010)

    Fancy a poem?: 

        When the world grew intolerant of those
        Who took to drink with the faint’st need for occasion,
        We and they return’d to our quarters and consummat’d
        Our wills through the pleasures of intoxicat’d introspection
        Under pallid shadow and the dimly bell

    List:

    	2.18 Hatred Hallows the Marching Meek
    	Fickle Child (Come On) Home
    	Rustling Mammoths Know, Saints Tow
    	Trees Become Tombstones for Themselves 
    	Him Who Loved Us in the Home Found Lost
    	Dishevel'd Procession
    	Sympathetic Symptomatic

2. The Matters of Matter

	A poem:

		The serendipitous, sporadic holidays 
		Which teach nothing less than the beauty 
		Of nothingness, 

		And the lies which bind it so warmly.

3. With Reflections Comes the Rent
	
	A poem:

		Hearts of nebulae must pay rent too; 
		but they shall dance; 
		they shall.

4. Languages
	
	A statement, but never a manifesto:

		We author the structures of science fiction;
		and We author nothing else.

5. "Rough Draft"

	The intersections and recapitulations of death and the romantic.

6. A September Before the Winter (October 2011)

	An album inspired by: 
	 
		death, 
		restitution, 
		unforgivable obduracy, 
		the failure in human-projects, 
		and John Cusack’s deep, middle-class eyes.

# “Logo”

It’s not a logo. It’s a stolen crop of one of the feline angels in GY!BE’s “hammers of hope” illustration. I’m appropriating it as I believe there is a strong harmony in meaning between what the angels represent and that these sounds are hopes to expression.
