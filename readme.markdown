# A Query

These are explorations into the externalization of a supposed homogeneous organization of pheNOMonological, or being candid: pre-ontological experience, should the neologism be so repugnant to the mind. Supposing experience is intentionally structured, what might categorically dissimilar experiences, such as the linguistic experience and the physical experience; allowing that one perceives their vacuity in canonicalization. Bankruptcy follows at assuming the logical equivalence of the world as a totality of parts and language as a totality of canonical forms; where each presupposes a prior lexical representation. In that, to ask questions within such a supposed organization of experience, intentionally structured, what would its reverberation sound like?

# A Response

It is not enough to say "self-taught"; these are sonic transliterations of self to public, undergone seemingly tragic loss and the bankruptcy of post-analytic reasoning. I have no interest in the guitar as a philosophical, paradigmatic project, with its normative claims, language games, and 138 different nail shapes.

1. Death Rites (October 2010)

    When the world grew intolerant of those
    Who took to drink with the faint’st need for occasion,
    We and they return’d to our quarters and consummat’d
    Our wills through the pleasures of intoxicat’d introspection
    Under pallid shadow and the dimly bell
